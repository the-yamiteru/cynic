# Modularity

There are several ways in which we can extend Cynic and make it even more powerful.

## Official

Thanks to function composition approch that Cynic uses we can create as many methods and event presets as we want without really affecting size or performance.

So if you have any ideas for new methods that should be a part of the official Cynic package then just go ahead and create a PR! 

## Unofficial

Since event is just an object with secret attributes hidden behind symbols you can basically do the same and merge your specific (ideally) secret attributes with the ones created by the official event. 

## Abstract

Lastly you can just use the already existing event and all the (in)official methods and create abstractions on top of them to create something more powerful or focused on a specific use-case.
